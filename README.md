###Home At Last

##App Description:
Home At Last is a real estate app that lets users browse home listings other users have posted in one of the supported cities.

Potential Homebuyers can also "like" the properties that appeal to them to pin these properties on their dashboard for quicker access and reference.

If a user is interested in selling a property, they can also make a listing as long as they have an account and are logged in.

Users will be able to edit or remove their own listings and Admin users will be able to edit or remove any listing.
